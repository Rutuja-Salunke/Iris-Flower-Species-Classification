**Iris Flower Species Classification Project:**

1. **Data Loading and Overview:**
   - Imported necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly express.
   - Loaded the Iris dataset using `pd.read_csv()`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Checked basic dataset information using `df.info()` and statistical summaries with `df.describe()`.
   - Examined the presence of missing values using `df.isna().sum()`.
   - Visualized class distribution using `sns.countplot()`.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Encoded categorical target variable ('Species') using LabelEncoder.
   - Identified and handled outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.

4. **Data Standardization:**
   - Applied StandardScaler to normalize feature values.

5. **Feature Selection and Linearity:**
   - Explored feature correlations through a heatmap using `sns.heatmap()`.
   - Selected features for model training based on correlation analysis.

10. **Hyperparameter Tuning (RandomizedSearchCV):**
    - Performed hyperparameter tuning for Decision Tree using `RandomizedSearchCV()`.

11. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
    - Introduced K-Nearest Neighbors as an alternative classification approach.
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**

***Definition:***
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In classification, it assigns an input data point to the majority class among its K-nearest neighbors. In regression, it predicts the output based on the average of the values of its K-nearest neighbors.

***Key Concepts:***

1. ***Distance Measure:***
   - KNN relies on a distance metric (usually Euclidean distance) to calculate the similarity between data points. The algorithm identifies the K-nearest neighbors of a given data point based on this measure.

2. ***Parameter K:***
   - K represents the number of neighbors considered for decision-making. Choosing an appropriate K is crucial. A small K may lead to noise sensitivity, while a large K may result in oversmoothing.

3. ***Classification:***
   - In a classification task, the class label of an unseen data point is determined by a majority vote among its K-nearest neighbors. The class with the highest count becomes the predicted class for the data point.

4. ***Regression:***
   - For regression tasks, KNN calculates the average of the target values of its K-nearest neighbors to predict the target value for the unseen data point.

**Workflow:**

   1. **Calculate Distances:**
     - Compute the distance between the input data point and all other data points in the training set using the chosen distance metric.

   2. **Identify Neighbors:**
     - Select the K-nearest neighbors based on the calculated distances.

   3. **Majority Vote (Classification) or Average (Regression):**
     - For classification, assign the class label that occurs most frequently among the K-nearest neighbors. For regression, predict the average of their target values.

**Advantages:**
- Simple and easy to understand.
- No training phase; the algorithm directly uses the training data during prediction.
- Works well for small to moderately sized datasets.

**Challenges:**
- Sensitive to irrelevant or redundant features.
- Computationally expensive for large datasets.
- Optimal choice of K is critical and may vary for different datasets.


12. **Visualization:**
    - Plotted decision boundaries for Logistic Regression.
